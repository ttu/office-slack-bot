* Execute Step 1: Turn on the Google Calendar API from [quicksart](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/nodejs). Save file as client_secret.json
* Execute `npm run create_token` to store authentication token to json-file. This file is not in version control
* Both files need to be in the workspace root

```js
translator: {
    keyPath: '/home/user123/office-slack-bot/translate_secret.json',
    prefix: ':flag-england: ',
    language: 'en',            
    maxCharacters: 1000,    
    channels: {
        aaaaa: {
            enabled: true
        },
        xxxxx: {
            enabled: true
        }
    }
